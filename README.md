# CustomerDirectory_REST
-Description: 
This program reads from a database that contains a table with customer data ('Customers'). A Customers entity is created to that maps the attributes of each Customer object in the table. With the help of REST API and REST Client, CRUD operations are performed on the table. A table is generated using HTML, to showcase the customers in the database. On the web page users can either add a new customer by entering all the details in a form, delete an existing customer or update customer details. All changes are made to the database and the table is generated directly from the database. User receives messages based on action performed.

-What I learned:
Performing CRUD operations using REST API.

-Usage:
REST url is http://localhost/3280/Lab%2010/Lab10%20Working/Lab10-ADa-83182.php and so localhost name must be '3280'.
